# 4.10: CI/CD and Deployment with ArgoCD

In this project, I've set up a GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD to automate deployments to Kubernetes. Hereâ€™s how I've configured it to work.

## The GitOps Workflow

My deployment process is fully automated. I've configured two distinct environments: `staging` and `production`.

### Staging Deployment

I've set up the pipeline so that every commit I push to the `main` branch automatically deploys to the **staging environment**.

Here's the step-by-step flow:

1.  **Push to `main`**: When I push a code change to the `main` branch, it triggers my `deploy-staging.yaml` GitHub Actions workflow.
2.  **Build & Push Image**: The workflow builds a new Docker image for the application and pushes it to my container registry. The image is tagged with the unique commit SHA to ensure every version is distinct.
3.  **Update Manifests**: The workflow then automatically updates the `kustomization.yaml` file located in `project-gitops-config-repo/apps/todo-app/overlays/staging/`. It changes the image tag to the new one I just built.
4.  **ArgoCD Syncs**: My ArgoCD instance is configured to continuously monitor the `project-gitops-config-repo` repository. When it sees the change in the staging manifest, it automatically syncs the application.
5.  **Deployment**: ArgoCD pulls the new container image and deploys it to the `staging` namespace in my Kubernetes cluster.

### Production Deployment

For production, I wanted a more deliberate release process. Instead of deploying on every commit, I trigger deployments by creating a **tagged commit** (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`).

The flow is the same as staging, but it's triggered by a tag and updates the `production` overlay instead:

1.  **Create a Tag**: I create a new Git tag and push it to the repository.
2.  **GitHub Actions Trigger**: This triggers the `deploy-production.yaml` workflow.
3.  **Build & Push Image**: The image is built and pushed, but this time it's tagged with the Git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
4.  **Update Manifests**: The workflow updates the `kustomization.yaml` in the `project-gitops-config-repo/apps/todo-app/overlays/production/` directory.
5.  **ArgoCD Deploys**: ArgoCD detects the change and deploys the new version to the `production` namespace.

## One-Time ArgoCD Setup

To get this entire workflow started, I needed to configure ArgoCD to monitor my applications. I did this by applying the "app-of-apps" manifests from my `project-gitops-config-repo`. This was the only manual `kubectl` step I needed for the applications.

I ran the following commands to bootstrap the environments:

```bash
# Apply the staging app-of-apps manifest
kubectl apply -f project-gitops-config-repo/argocd/apps-of-apps/staging.yaml

# Apply the production app-of-apps manifest
kubectl apply -f project-gitops-config-repo/argocd/apps-of-apps/production.yaml
```

After running these, ArgoCD took over and started managing the deployments based on the manifests in my Git repository.
